/** Supervised by [[actors.SentimentCardsManager]], this actor manages
 *  the processing of comments over a sentiment card. It uses
 *  static children to further process comment data and obtain 
 *  semantic characteristics for the sentiment card.
 *
 *  The current children are: [[actors.SentimentStats]], [[actors.Folksonomy]].
 *
 *  The complete work flow:
 *
 *  (1) This [[actors.SentimentCard]] receives an [[actors.Comment]]
 *  message, which is redirected to a newly born [[actors.SentimentAPIRequester]]
 *  actor.
 *
 *  (2) The SentimentAPIRequester sends an http request to the
 *  sentiment restful api.
 *
 *  (3) The SentimentAPIRequester receives the processed comment,
 *  formats it and sends it back to this SentimentCard using a
 *  [[actors.CommentData]] message.
 *
 *  (4) This SentimentCard destroys the api requester and redirects
 *  the data to it's children.
 *
 *  (5) The children reactively respond by publishing any changes on
 *  the semantic characteristics that they manage. Web clients can
 *  subscribe to this events through the [[actors.WebSocketRouter]],
 *  so that they receive updates on the semantic characteristics of
 *  the sentiment card.
 *
 *  This actor also receives redirections of [[actors.ClientSubscription]]
 *  messages, which notify that a client through a web socket subscribed
 *  to the 'new-card' event, when notified this card pushes his information
 *  through a [[actors.CardNew]] message to the 
 *  subscribed socket.
